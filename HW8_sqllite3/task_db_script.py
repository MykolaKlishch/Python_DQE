"""Imports data from csv files into the new database
and provides the ability to execute queries on it.

Detailed description:
 1. Creates sqlite3 database.
 2. Creates two tables in the database: projects_tbl and tasks_tbl.
    Defines column names, column data types, relations and constraints.
 3. Imports data from .csv files and inserts these data into
    the respective tables.
 4. Takes user input in a form of executable SQLite query.
    In order to extend functionality, user input requires a full query,
    not just a part of it. Queries on both tables using JOIN are
    supported as well. Despite default hardcoded query is specified
    and is executed if no user input is provided.
 5. Prints selected data in a table. Automatically detects column width.

File names, database and table names, column names, column data types,
relations and constraints are hardcoded because formatting sql queries
is not safe due to potential SQL injections. File content can be
modified as long as these modifications do not contradict with
data types and constraints.
