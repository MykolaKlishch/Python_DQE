def choose_pos_bot(board, player):
    """Implements a strategy of a perfect tic-tac-toe player.

    The strategy is implemented as a sequence of cases
    that should be checked one after another
    until the right case is found:

    #1. Win: If the player has two in a row,
    they can place a third to get three in a row.

    #2. Block: If the opponent has two in a row,
    the player must play the third themselves to block the opponent.

    #3. Fork: Create an opportunity where the player
    has two ways to win (two non-blocked lines of 2).

    #4. Blocking an opponent's fork:
    4.1. If there is only one possible fork for the opponent,
         the player should block it.
    4.2. Otherwise, the player should create a two in a row
         to force the opponent into defending,
         as long as it doesn't result in them creating a fork.
         For example, if "x" has two opposite corners
         and "O" has the center, "o" must not play a corner
         in order to win. (Playing a corner in this scenario
         creates a fork for "x" to win.)

    #5. Center: A player marks the center.
    (If it is the first move of the game, playing on a corner
    gives the second player more opportunities to make a mistake
    and may therefore be the better choice; however, it makes
    no difference between perfect players.)

    #6. Opposite corner: If the opponent is in the corner,
    the player plays the opposite corner.

    #7. Empty corner: The player plays in a corner square.
    #8. Empty side: The player plays in a middle square
    on any of the 4 sides.
