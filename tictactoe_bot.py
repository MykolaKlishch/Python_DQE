    # The strategy is implemented as a sequence of cases
    # that are checked one after another until the right
    # case is found:
    #
    # 1. Win: If the player has two in a row,
    # they can place a third to get three in a row.
    #
    # 2. Block: If the opponent has two in a row,
    # the player must play the third themselves to block the opponent.
    #
    # 3. Fork: Create an opportunity where the player
    # has two ways to win (two non-blocked lines of 2).
    #
    # 4. Blocking an opponent's fork:
    # 4.1. If there is only one possible fork for the opponent,
    #      the player should block it.
    # 4.2. Otherwise, the player should create a two in a row
    #      to force the opponent into defending,
    #      as long as it doesn't result in them creating a fork.
    #      For example, if "x" has two opposite corners
    #      and "O" has the center, "o" must not play a corner
    #      in order to win. (Playing a corner in this scenario
    #      creates a fork for "x" to win.)
    #
    # 5. Center: A player marks the center.
    # (If it is the first move of the game, playing on a corner
    # gives the second player more opportunities to make a mistake
    # and may therefore be the better choice; however, it makes
    # no difference between perfect players.)
    #
    # 6. Opposite corner: If the opponent is in the corner,
    # the player plays the opposite corner.
    #
    # 7. Empty corner: The player plays in a corner square.
    #
    # 8. Empty side: The player plays in a middle square
    # on any of the 4 sides.
